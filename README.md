# wow-guild-recruitment

## Purpose and Value
Simple guild recruitment board for World of Warcraft. Users can post guild ads with guild name, role and realm.

## User Stories
- As a visitor, I can see a list of guild ads so I can find active guilds.
- As a logged-in user, I can create a guild ad (guild name, role, realm) so I can recruit players.
- As the ad owner, I can edit my ad so I can correct details without creating a new one.
- As the ad owner, I can delete my ad so I can remove outdated posts.
- As a user, I can log in/out so I can manage my ads.
